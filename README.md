This project leverages GeoFire, Google Maps SDK, Directions API, and Firebase to provide a robust location tracking solution.

## Features
* Admin and Employee Roles: Admins can monitor the location of their employees.
* Real-Time Location Tracking: Track the live locations of employees using GeoFire.
* Route Visualization: Display the routes taken by employees on the map using polylines.
* Firebase Integration: Secure data storage and real-time database operations using Firebase.
## Technologies Used
* Kotlin: For Android app development.
* XML: For designing the user interface.
* GeoFire: For real-time location tracking.
* Google Maps SDK: For map functionalities and displaying locations.
* Directions API: For generating and displaying routes.
* Firebase: For database and authentication services.
